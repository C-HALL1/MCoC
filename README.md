## NHS England Data & Analytics - Analysis part of an MRES at the University of Leeds

### About the Project

[![status: archive](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/archive.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#archive)

[Link to original project propsoal TBD](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/)

_**Note:** No data is shared in this repository 

### Project Stucture TBD

- The main pipeline code is split into 2 (SQL and Pandas) and is found in the root of the repository. `Please see Usage below for more information`
- The accompanying [report](./reports/report.pdf) is also available in the `reports` folder
- More information about the code usage can be found in the [model card](./model_card.md)
- {OTHER REPO STRUCTURE}

### Built With

[![R version 4.2.1 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-v4.2.1-blue.svg)]([https://www.r-project.org/])
[![pandas version 1.2.1.2 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-v1.21.2-blue.svg)]([https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.2.1.html#])

### Getting Started
This code uses standard data processing techniques and statistical tests applied to a specific dataset. 
As such, it is not viewed as "a custom algorithm or software central to the paper and has not been reported previously in a published research paper", so is not at production standard for those without access to NHS England's secure Data Access Environment, 
which is strictly controlled given the need to ensure patient confidentiality, but is being made available to maximise transparency.

#### Installation

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/C-HALL/MCoC`

To use the code 'as-is' you will need:
 `Access to NHS England's internal secure data environment`
 `Access to the Maternity Services Dataset`

Alternatively, to replicate thie piece of work outside of NHS England, you will need to apply for access to Maternity Services Dataset through the [Dataset Access Request Service (DARS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars#apply-through-dars-online). Then edit the queries to use the Maternity Services Dataset DARS data structure.


Please contact [chris.roebuck@nhs.net](mailto:chris.roebuck@nhs.net) or [charlotte.atherden@nhs.net](mailto:charlotte.atherden@nhs.net) with any questions about using or adapting the code. 

### Usage
The main pipeline is run first. The main pipline is split into two. Part 1 contains SQL code. The output of the SQL code feeds directly into part 2 which is written in Pandas. 

#### Outputs
{LIST AND DESCRIPTION OF OUTPUTS TBD}

{NOTES ON REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESULTS TBD}

#### Datasets
This data uses the Maternity Services Dataset (MSDS).
