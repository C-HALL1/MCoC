## Analysis produced as part of an MRES at the University of Leeds in affiliation with NHS England Data & Analytics

### About the Project

[![status: archive](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/archive.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#archive)

This repository contains the code used for the paper 'Roebuck, C., Sandall, J., West, R. et al. Impact of midwife continuity of carer on stillbirth rate and first feed in England. Commun Med 5, 339 (2025). [DOI.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01025-z')

**Note:** No data is shared in this repository 

### Project Structure 

- The main pipeline code is split into 3  and is found in the root of the repository. `Please see Usage below for more information`
- The output of each part will feed into the next part of the code.
- The output of the main pipeline contains the data used for the results of the paper. 
- Regression models in python are then used for comparison against the main regression model in R to quality assure the analysis. 

### Built With

[![R version 4.2.1 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-v4.2.1-blue.svg)]([https://www.r-project.org/])
[![pandas version 1.2.1.2 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-v1.21.2-blue.svg)]([https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.2.1.html#])

### Getting Started
This code uses standard data processing techniques and statistical tests applied to a specific dataset. 
As such, it is not viewed as "a custom algorithm or software central to the paper and has not been reported previously in a published research paper", so is not at production standard for those without access to NHS England's secure Data Access Environment, 
which is strictly controlled given the need to ensure patient confidentiality, but is being made available to maximise transparency.

#### Installation

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/C-HALL/MCoC`

To use the code 'as-is' you will need:
 `Access to NHS England's internal secure data environment`
 `Access to the Maternity Services Dataset`

Alternatively, to replicate this piece of work outside of NHS England, you will need to apply for access to Maternity Services Dataset through the [Dataset Access Request Service (DARS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars#apply-through-dars-online). Then edit the queries to use the Maternity Services Dataset DARS data structure.


Please contact [chris.roebuck@nhs.net](mailto:chris.roebuck@nhs.net), [charlotte.atherden@nhs.net](mailto:charlotte.atherden@nhs.net) or [k.parkyn@nhs.net](mailto:k.parkyn@nhs.net) with any questions about using or adapting the code. 

### Usage
The main pipeline is run first. The main pipline is split into three. Part 1 contains SQL code. Part 2 contains the Pandas code. Part 3 contains R code. The output of Part 1 feeds into the start of Part 2. The output of Part 2 feeds into the start of Part 3. 

The final stage of the pipeline in R Studio involves reformatting and creating additional derivations to underpin the statistical analysis, followed by running the statistical analysis (logistic regression model). A minimum set of core fields were exported from the Pandas section of the pipeline. This is the output used for the main results in the paper. 

Additional quality assurance then takes place in Python. Regression models are run in Python using K Learn to check the values returned are similar to those run by the main regression model in R. 


#### Outputs
The output of the main pipeline contains the data used for the results of the paper. 
Please see the published paper for the outputs of the analysis which are contained in the results and supplementary information sections. 

#### Datasets
This data uses the Maternity Services Dataset (MSDS).
