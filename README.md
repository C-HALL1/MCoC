### Built With

[![R version 4.2.1 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-v4.2.1-blue.svg)]([https://www.r-project.org/])

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/C-HALL/MCoC`

To use the code 'as-is' you will need:
 `Access to NHS England's internal secure data environment`
 `Access to the Maternity Services Dataset`

Alternatively, to replicate thie piece of work outside of NHS England, you will need to apply for access to Maternity Services Dataset through the [Dataset Access Request Service (DARS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars#apply-through-dars-online). Then edit the queries to use the Maternity Services Dataset DARS data structure.


Please contact [chris.roebuck@nhs.net](mailto:chris.roebuck@nhs.net) or [charlotte.atherden@nhs.net](mailto:charlotte.atherden@nhs.net) with any questions about using or adapting the code.
